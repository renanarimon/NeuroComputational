## Adaline & Backpropagation
Adaline is a single-layer artificial neural network. It consists of a weight, a 
bias, and a summation function.
In ADALINE Algorithm the weights are adjusted according to the weighted 
sum of the inputs (the net), but it uses a linear division.
The algorithm consists of three parts:
1. Feedforward - Learning input system.
2. Backpropagation -Calculation of the learning error 
3. Correcting the weights according to the calculation of the error

## Kohonen
A self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm is based on unsupervised, competitive learning. It
provides a topology preserving mapping from the high dimensional space to map
units. Map units, or neurons, usually form a two-dimensional lattice and thus the
mapping is a mapping from high dimensional space onto a plane.<br/>
You can read more about SOM here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map<br/>
